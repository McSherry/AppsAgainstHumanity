Apps Against Humanity (AAH) is an online version of the Cards Against Humanity (CAH) card game. It was written as a fun side project, and is intended to allow anyone to play CAH with anyone else, provided each person has a connection to the Internet.

Code contributions may be accepted depending on their significance.

###Suggestions & Bug Reports
These can be directed to us via [GitHub's issue system](https://github.com/McSherry/AppsAgainstHumanity/issues). For a list of currently-planned features and a list of known bugs, please refer to the wiki, and refrain from creating duplicate issues if one already exists.
